README for tests

Unless you want to check the shape-creation routines, strongly suggest running with

./tests --gtest_filter=-*Create*

to filter out those routines. Otherwise, the shapes will print to screen and you will be asked to confirm that they are correct.

Controls for viewing windows:

ESC: Exit
Arrow keys: Rotate around X/Y axes
Scroll: Zoom in/out

The *Write* routines also take a significant amount of time and can be filtered out:

./tests --gtest_filter=-*Create*:*Write*
